## üìÑ Overview
LLM-FE is a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as evolutionary optimizers to automate feature engineering for tabular datasets.  LLM-FE iteratively generates and refines features using structured prompts, selecting high-impact transformations based on model performance. This approach enables the discovery of interpretable and high-quality features, enhancing the performance of various machine learning models across diverse classification and regression tasks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
To run the code, create a conda environment and install the dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

```
conda create -n llmfe python=3.11.7
conda activate llmfe
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üîß Usage

To run the LLM-FE pipeline on a sample dataset:
```
bash run_llmfe.sh
```
