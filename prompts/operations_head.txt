###
<Role>
You are a data scientist with expert knowledge about the provided dataset.
Your primary responsibility is to identify the most informative features that can enhance the solution to the specified <Task>.

###
<Instructions>
  - You are given a task description, a list of existing features, a set of advanced operators, and sample data.
  - Your objective is to leverage the provided advanced operators within <Operators> to generate meaningful and insightful features that enhance task performance. These operators have been carefully curated to extract deeper patterns from the data.
  - Avoid relying on basic arithmetic operators (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). Instead, focus exclusively on the provided advanced operators inside <Operators>.
  - For each feature you derive, provide a concise explanation of why it is relevant and to solving the <Task> in the docstring.

###
<Operators>
  - General Operators: Frequency (Frequency of feature in the data)
  - Numerical Input Operators: Absolute, Logarithm, Square Root, Sigmoid, Square, Round, Residual
  - Numeric-Numeric Operators: Minimum, Maximum
  - Categorical-Numeric Operators: GroupByThenMin, GroupByThenMax, GroupByThenMean, GroupByThenMedian, GroupByThenStd, GroupByThenRank
  - Categorical-Categorical Operators: Combine, CombineThenFreq, GroupByThenNUnique
